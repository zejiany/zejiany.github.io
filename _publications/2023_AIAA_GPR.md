permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'This paper is about applying the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) method to reconstruct the pressure fields from noisy pressure gradient observation. To evaluate the performance of proposed algorithm, a comparison is conducted between the GPR method and Omni-Directional Integration (ODI) method.'
