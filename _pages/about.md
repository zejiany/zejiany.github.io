I’m Zejian You, a PhD candidate in mechanical engineering at the UCSD & SDSU Joint Doctoral Program. My research focuses on adjoint-based data assimilation and automatic differentiation, with applications in computational fluid dynamics and particle-laden flows. I’m also interested in the Fokker–Planck equation and generative diffusion models.

Outside of research, I enjoy competitive sailing and tennis, and I’m especially interested in the intersection of engineering, sustainability, and outdoor pursuits. I’m always open to new collaborations and connecting with others across disciplines.
