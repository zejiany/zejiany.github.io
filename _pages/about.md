I’m Zejian You, a PhD candidate in mechanical engineering at the UCSD & SDSU Joint Doctoral Program. My research focuses on adjoint-based data assimilation and automatic differentiation, with applications in computational fluid dynamics and particle-laden flows. I’m also interested in applying machine learning techniques, such as diffusion models, to fluid mechanics, and exploring connections between the Fokker–Planck equation and generative diffusion processes.

Outside of research, I enjoy competitive sailing and tennis, and I’m especially interested in the intersection of engineering, sustainability, and outdoor pursuits. I’m always open to new collaborations and connecting with others across disciplines.
