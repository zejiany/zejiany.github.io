  abstract = {The merging of a pair of symmetric, horizontally oriented vortices in unstratified and stably stratified viscous fluid is investigated. Two-dimensional numerical simulations are performed for a range of flow conditions. The merging process is resolved into four phases of development and key underlying physics are identified. In particular, the deformation of the vortices, explained in terms of the interaction of vorticity gradient, ∇{$\omega$}, and rate of strain,                                S                              , leads to a tilt in {$\omega$} contours in the vicinity of the center of rotation (a hyperbolic point). In the diffusive/deformation phase, diffusion of the vortices establishes the interaction between ∇{$\omega$} and mutually induced                                S                              . During the convective/deformation phase, induced flow by filaments and, in stratified flow, baroclinically generated vorticity (BV), advects the vortices thereby modifying                                S                              , which, in general, may enhance or hinder the development of the tilt. The tilting and diffusion of {$\omega$} near the center hyperbolic point causes {$\omega$} from the core region to enter the exchange band where it is entrained. In the convective/entrainment phase, the vortex cores are thereby eroded and ultimately entrained into the exchange band, whose induced flow becomes dominant and transforms the flow into a single vortex. The critical aspect ratio, associated with the start of the convective/entrainment phase, is found to be the same for both the unstratified and stratified flows. In the final diffusive/axisymmetrization phase, the flow evolves towards axisymmetry by diffusion. In general, the effects of stratification depend on the ratio of the diffusive time scale (growth of cores) to the turnover time (establishment of BV), i.e. the Reynolds number. A crossover Reynolds number is found, above which convective merging is accelerated with respect to unstratified flow and below which it is delayed.},

  abstract = {Smoke from the 2018 Camp Fire in Northern California blanketed a large part of the region for 2 weeks, creating poor air quality in the ``unhealthy'' range for millions of people. The NOAA Global System Laboratory's HRRR-Smoke model was operating experimentally in real time during the Camp Fire. Here, output from the HRRR-Smoke model is compared to surface observations of PM2.5 from AQS and PurpleAir sensors as well as satellite observation data. The HRRR-Smoke model at 3-km resolution successfully simulated the evolution of the plume during the initial phase of the fire (8--10 November 2018). Stereoscopic satellite plume height retrievals were used to compare with model output (for the first time, to the authors' knowledge), showing that HRRR-Smoke is able to represent the complex 3D distribution of the smoke plume over complex terrain. On 15--16 November, HRRR-Smoke was able to capture the intensification of PM2.5 pollution due to a high pressure system and subsidence that trapped smoke close to the surface; however, HRRR-Smoke later underpredicted PM2.5 levels due to likely underestimates of the fire radiative power (FRP) derived from satellite observations. The intensity of the Camp Fire smoke event and the resulting pollution during the stagnation episodes make it an excellent test case for HRRR-Smoke in predicting PM2.5 levels, which were so high from this single fire event that the usual anthropogenic pollution sources became insignificant. The HRRR-Smoke model was implemented operationally at NOAA/NCEP in December 2020, now providing essential support for smoke forecasting as the impact of U.S. wildfires continues to increase in scope and magnitude.},

  abstract = {The ability to determine the source of a contaminant plume in urban environments is crucial for emergency-response applications. Locating the source and determining its strength based on downwind concentration measurements, however, are complicated by the presence of buildings that can divert flow in unexpected directions. High-resolution flow simulations are now possible for predicting plume evolution in complex urban geometries, where contaminant dispersion is affected by the flow around individual buildings. Using Bayesian inference via stochastic sampling algorithms with a high-resolution computational fluid dynamics model, an atmospheric release event can be reconstructed to determine the plume source and release rate based on point measurements of concentration. Event-reconstruction algorithms are applied first for flow around a prototype isolated building (a cube) and then using observations and flow conditions from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, during the Joint Urban 2003 field campaign. Stochastic sampling methods (Markov chain Monte Carlo) are used to extract likely source parameters, taking into consideration measurement and forward model errors. In all cases the steady-state flow field generated by a 3D Navier--Stokes finite-element code (FEM3MP) is used to drive thousands of forward-dispersion simulations. To enhance computational performance in the inversion procedure, a reusable database of dispersion simulation results is created. It is possible to successfully invert the dispersion problems to determine the source location and release rate to within narrow confidence intervals even with such complex geometries. The stochastic methodology here is general and can be used for time-varying release rates and reactive flow conditions. The results of inversion indicate the probability of a source being found at a particular location with a particular release rate, thus inherently reflecting uncertainty in observed data or the lack of enough data in the shape and size of the probability distribution. A composite plume showing concentrations at the desired confidence level can also be constructed using the realizations from the reconstructed probability distribution. This can be used by emergency responders as a tool to determine the likelihood of concentration at a particular location being above a threshold value.},

  abstract = {The forcing of particles in turbulent environments influences dynamical properties pertinent to many fundamental applications involving particle-flow interactions. Current study explores the determination of forcing for one-way coupled passive particles, under the assumption that the ambient velocity fields are known. When measurements regarding particle locations are available but sparse, direct evaluation of the forcing is intractable. Nevertheless, the forcing for finite-size particles can be determined using adjoint-based data assimilation. This inverse problem is formulated with the framework of optimization, where the cost function is defined as the difference between the measured and predicted particle locations. The gradient of the cost function, with respect to the forcing can be calculated from the adjoint dynamics. When measurements are subject to Gaussian noise, samples within the probability distribution of the forcing can be drawn using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. The algorithm is tested in the Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flow as well as the homogeneous isotropic turbulence. Results demonstrate that the forcing can only be determined accurately for particle Reynolds number between 1 and 5, where the majority of Reynolds number history along the particle trajectory falls in.},

Pollutant sources are identified by matching simulated and measured nonreacting solute concentration data. We have assumed known hydraulic parameters but considered concentration data errors explicitly. The identification models are demonstrated and compared using two hypothetical aquifer systems, one for the steady state case and the other for the transient case. Steady state models identified unknown pipe leak locations and leak magnitudes based upon sparse and spatially distributed chloride and tritium data. The number of likely leak locations was restricted in the models by employing mixed integer programing and stepwise multiple regression. Transient models identified several annual disposal fluxes in the aquifer based upon concentration histories collected at observation wells. In this case, conservative solute concentration data were abundant and contained substantial errors. Minimizing either least absolute or least squared errors was successful in identifying pollutant sources. Furthermore, we demonstrate error analysis for the results given by either method.},

  abstract = {The problem of determining the source of an emission from the limited information provided by a finite and noisy set of concentration measurements obtained from real-time sensors is an ill-posed inverse problem. In general, this problem cannot be solved uniquely without additional information. A Bayesian probabilistic inferential framework, which provides a natural means for incorporating both errors (model and observational) and prior (additional) information about the source, is presented. Here, Bayesian inference is applied to find the posterior probability density function of the source parameters (location and strength) given a set of concentration measurements. It is shown how the source--receptor relationship required in the determination of the likelihood function can be efficiently calculated using the adjoint of the transport equation for the scalar concentration. The posterior distribution of the source parameters is sampled using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. The inverse source determination method is validated against real data sets acquired in a highly disturbed flow field in an urban environment. The data sets used to validate the proposed methodology include a water-channel simulation of the near-field dispersion of contaminant plumes in a large array of building-like obstacles (Mock Urban Setting Trial) and a full-scale field experiment (Joint Urban 2003) in Oklahoma City. These two examples demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach for inverse source determination.},

At intermediate distances from the wall, the one-dimensional spectrum of the streamwise velocity fluctuation in both the streamwise and spanwise directions exhibits                                                                      \$k{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$                                               dependence over a short range in wavenumber                                                                      \$(k)\$                                               .

The analysis in this paper indicates that the primary importance of the fringe region technique is to damp out the deviation associated with large scales in the direction normal to the wall. The lack of boundary conditions is compensated by the knowledge of an exact solution in the fringe region of the computational domain. The upstream influence from the fringe region is small.

  abstract = {The interface-capturing-fidelity issue of the level set method is addressed wholly within the Eulerian framework. Our aim is for a practical and efficient way to realize the expected benefits of grid resolution and high order schemes. Based on a combination of structured adaptive mesh refinement (SAMR), rather than quad/octrees, and on high-order spatial discretization, rather than the use of Lagrangian particles, our method is tailored to compressible flows, while it provides a potentially useful alternative to the particle level set (PLS) for incompressible flows. Interesting salient features of our method include (a) avoidance of limiting (in treating the Hamiltonian of the level set equation), (b) anchoring the level set in a manner that ensures no drift and no spurious oscillations of the zero level during PDE-reinitialization, and (c) a non-linear tagging procedure for defining the neighborhood of the interface subject to mesh refinement. Numerous computational results on a set of benchmark problems (strongly deforming, stretching and tearing interfaces) demonstrate that with this approach, implemented up to 11th order accuracy, the level set method becomes essentially free of mass conservation errors and also free of parasitic interfacial oscillations, while it is still highly efficient, and convenient for 3D parallel implementation. In addition, demonstration of performance in fully-coupled simulations is presented for multimode Rayleigh--Taylor instability (low-Mach number regime) and shock-induced, bubble-collapse (highly compressible regime).},

  abstract = {A scale-dependent dynamic subgrid-scale model for large-eddy simulation of turbulent  flows is proposed. Unlike the traditional dynamic model, it does not rely on the  assumption that the model coefficient is scale invariant. The model is based on a  second test-filtering operation which allows us to determine from the simulation how  the coefficient varies with scale. The scale-dependent model is tested in simulations  of a neutral atmospheric boundary layer. In this application, near the ground the  grid scale is by necessity comparable to the local integral scale (of the order of the  distance to the wall). With the grid scale and/or the test-filter scale being outside the  inertial range, scale invariance is broken. The results are compared with those from  (               a               ) the traditional Smagorinsky model that requires specification of the coefficient and  of a wall damping function, and (               b               ) the standard dynamic model that assumes scale  invariance of the coefficient. In the near-surface region the traditional Smagorinsky  and standard dynamic models are too dissipative and not dissipative enough, respectively.  Simulations with the scale-dependent dynamic model yield the expected trends  of the coefficient as a function of scale and give improved predictions of velocity  spectra at different heights from the ground. Consistent with the improved dissipation  characteristics, the scale-dependent model also yields improved mean velocity profiles.},

  abstract = {This paper analyses the adjoint solution of the Navier--Stokes equation. We focus on flow across a circular cylinder at three Reynolds numbers, ReD = 20, 100 and 500. The quantity of interest in the adjoint formulation is the drag on the cylinder. We use classical fluid mechanics approaches to analyse the adjoint solution, which is a vector field similar to a flow field. Production and dissipation of kinetic energy of the adjoint field is discussed. We also derive the evolution of circulation of the adjoint field along a closed material contour. These analytical results are used to explain three numerical solutions of the adjoint equations presented in this paper. The adjoint solution at ReD = 20, a viscous steady state flow, exhibits a downstream suction and an upstream jet, the opposite of the expected behaviour of a flow field. The adjoint solution at ReD = 100, a periodic two-dimensional unsteady flow, exhibits periodic, bean-shaped circulation in the near-wake region. The adjoint solution at ReD = 500, a turbulent three-dimensional unsteady flow, has complex dynamics created by the shear layer in the near wake. The magnitude of the adjoint solution increases exponentially at the rate of the first Lyapunov exponent. These numerical results correlate well with the theoretical analysis presented in this paper.},

  abstract = {Identifying the source of passive scalar transported in a turbulent environment from remote measurements is an ill-posed problem due to the irreversibility of diffusive processes. A significant difficulty of the source reconstruction is due to different potential source locations generating very highly correlated signals at the sensor. A variational algorithm is formulated, which utilizes high-fidelity simulations to reconstruct the spatial distribution of the source. A cost functional is defined based on the difference between the true measurements and their prediction from the simulations with the estimated source. Using forward--adjoint looping, the gradient of the cost functional with respect to the source distribution is evaluated, and the estimate of the source is updated. The adjoint-variational approach naturally accommodates measurements from multiple sensors, with essentially the same computational cost. The algorithm is evaluated for scalar dispersion in turbulent channel flow. When a single sensor is placed directly downstream of the source, the reconstruction is accurate in the cross-stream directions and is elongated in the streamwise direction. The estimated source, however, can reproduce the measurements and the scalar plume downstream of the sensor location. In the channel centre and log layer, the scalar fields are dominated by dispersion, and therefore the reconstruction is better than in the near-wall regions, where the scalar fields are dominated by diffusion. When a sensor is placed near the wall, the accuracy of the source recovery deteriorates due to diffusive effects. By using more sensors that span the plume cross-section, improvement of performance can be demonstrated despite an enlarged domain of dependence.},

These simulations, run using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model with the addition of an immersed boundary method, predict transport and mixing during a controlled tracer release from the Joint Urban 2003 field campaign in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. This work extends the results of a recent study through analysis of turbulence kinetic energy and turbulence spectra and their role in accurately simulating wind speed, direction, and tracer concentration. The significance and role of surface heat fluxes and use of the cell perturbation method in the numerical simulation setup are also examined. Our previous study detailed the model development necessary for our multiscale simulations, examined model skill at predicting wind speeds and tracer concentrations, and demonstrated that dynamic downscaling from mesoscale to microscale through a sequence of nested simulations can improve predictions of transport and dispersion relative to a microscale-only simulation forced by idealized meteorology. Here, predictions are compared with observations to assess qualitative agreement and statistical model skill at predicting wind speed, wind direction, tracer concentration, and turbulent kinetic energy at locations throughout the city. We also investigate the scale distribution of turbulence and the associated impact on model skill, particularly for predictions of transport and dispersion. Our results show that downscaled large-scale turbulence, which is unique to the multiscale simulations, significantly improves predictions of tracer concentrations in this complex urban environment.},

  abstract = {The pioneering work of Jaynes in Bayesian/maximum entropy methods has been successfully explored in many disciplines. The principle of maximum entropy (PME) is a powerful and versatile tool of inferring a probability distribution from constraints that do not completely characterize that distribution. Minimum relative entropy (MRE) is a method which has all the important attributes of the maximum entropy approach with the advantage that prior information may be easily included. In this paper we use MRE to determine the prior probability density function (pdf) of a set of model parameters based on limited information. The resulting pdf is used in Monte Carlo simulations to provide expected values in field variables such as concentration, and confidence limits. We compare the probabilistic results from a traditional advection-dispersion (ADE) model based on volumetric averaging concepts with that of a model based on the assumption that the hydraulic conductivity is a stationary stochastic process. The results suggest that although Naff's (1990) model satisfies the observed data to a better degree than ADE model, the upper and lower confidence bands about the mean value are larger than the ADE results. This result we attribute to the fact that Naff's (1990) model simply contains more parameters, each of which is unknown and has to be estimated. There is no statistical difference between the expected values of second-spatial moments for the two models. The examples presented in this paper illustrate problems associated with assigning Gaussian pdfs as priors in a probabilistic model. First, such an assumption for the input parameters actually injects more information into the problem than may actually exist, whether consciously or unconsciously. This fact is borne out by comparison with minimum relative entropy theory. Second, the output parameters as suggested from the Monte Carlo analysis cannot be assumed to be Gaussian distributed even when the prior pdf is Gaussian in form. In a practical setting, the significance of this result and the approximation of Gaussian form would depend on the toxicity and environmental standards that apply to the problem.},

  abstract = {In scenarios involving sudden releases of unidentified gases or concealed pollution emergencies, source control emerges as a critical procedure to safeguard residential air quality. Appropriate inverse source tracking meth\- odology depending on diverse measurement data could be utilized to promptly identify pollutant source pa\- rameters. In this study, source term estimation (STE) method, i.e., jointly combining probability adjoint method with the Bayesian inference method, has been proposed. General form of the pollutant inverse transport equation was firstly established. Subsequently, the pollution source information, assumed from single continuous point releases during Fusion Field Trials 2007 under an unsteady wind field, was identified using the Bayesian inference probability adjoint inverse method. Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MH-MCMC) and Differential Evolution Markov Chain Monte Carlo (DE-MCMC) were then compared as sampling methods for Bayesian inference. Results indicated that the DE-MCMC algorithm has superior convergence and could present higher accuracy of pollutant source information than that of MH-MCMC algorithm, particularly for highly nonlinear and multi-modal distribution systems. Furthermore, the integration of Union standard Adjoint Loca\- tion Probability (UALP) as prior information into the Bayesian inference probability adjoint inverse method effectively narrowed the sampling range, enhancing both the accuracy and robustness of the proposed approach. Finally, the impact of the covariance matrix on the inverse identification accuracy was explored. Overall, this research has provided insights into the future applicability of this Bayesian inference inversion technique for point source identification.},
