This is a reading note about fractional derivative. And the textbook will be:
1. [Fractional Differential Equations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/bookseries/mathematics-in-science-and-engineering/vol/198/suppl/C)


The motivation of learning the fractional differential equation is to further understand the history force in particle-laden flow, which is a fractional derivative of order $1/2$ in Riemann-Liouville sense. And the preface of the textbook also mentions that fractional derivative provide an excellment instrument for the description of memory and hereditary properties of various material and processes.
